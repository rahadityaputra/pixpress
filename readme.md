# PixPress: Web Image Compression Tool

PixPress is a modern web application for compressing and optimizing images. Built with React and Radix UI for the frontend and Node.js with Sharp.js for the backend, PixPress provides a simple and efficient way for users to reduce image file sizes without significant loss of visual quality.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Flexible Compression Modes**  
  - **Resize**: Set specific width and height dimensions to scale your images.  
  - **Target File Size**: Automatically adjust image quality to achieve a specific file size (e.g., 200 KB).

- **Multiple File Formats**  
  - Output as **JPEG** (lossy, smaller files) or **PNG** (lossless, higher quality).

- **Before & After Comparison**  
  - View your original and compressed images side by side, including file size and percentage saved.

- **Batch Processing**  
  - Upload and compress multiple images at once.

- **Single ZIP Download**  
  - Download all compressed images in a single `.zip` file for convenience.

- **Responsive and Accessible UI**  
  - Built with **Radix UI** to ensure a modern, accessible, and responsive experience.
